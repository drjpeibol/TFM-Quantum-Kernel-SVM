## General info
This project's motivation is to study the viability of quantum computing in machine learning systems's training proccess. We'll study its use in classification problems and Suppor Vector Machines. 

We'll use the work developed by Havlíček, V., Córcoles, A.D., Temme, K. et al in their publication ["Supervised learning with quantum-enhanced feature spaces". Nature 567, 209–212 (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11326.pdf) as the baseline for our studies.

In our work, quantum support vector machines with quantum kernels were implemented and compared with their classical counterparts. The findings demonstrate the potential of quantum support vector machines as powerful tools in data classification, laying the foundation for future research and advancements in this exciting field of quantum computing and machine learning.
